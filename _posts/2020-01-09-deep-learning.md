Convetional event detection method uses the rate-of-change-of-frequency (ROCOF) signal to indicate events. It introduces a large amount of false alarms due to the complexity of the disturbance events.
The deep learning based event detection and verification data exploits the power of convolutional neural network, proposing a novel model to use the ROCOF and phase angle data to provide accurate event detection results.
